# FastAPI User Guide

# About

This repository contains the tutorial for Python FastAPI Framework(https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).
I have created a python file for each topic in the tutorial. Each commit in the file is a subtopic of the main topics of the tutorial. 
I have used Python 3.9 for this tutorial (Main difference between Python 3.9 and 3.10 is the use of "Union and Annotated")
